# adventofcode

This is messy repo for the adventofcode 2017's christimas resolutions, all done in Javascript.

Advent of Code is a advent christimas calendar, made up of small programming puzzles. You can see and do the challenges in this repo [here](http://http://adventofcode.com/2017/).

I intend to improve these resolutions whenever I have time, since this was done in an attempt to learn and improve my Javascript skills.

Clone this repo:
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/berqs/adventofcode.git
```
